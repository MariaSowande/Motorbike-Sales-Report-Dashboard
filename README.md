# Motorbike-Sales-Report-Dashboard
This project was intended to analyze the Jack's Store sales data for the purpose of deciding the right target audience for ads. The raw data was analyzed, cleaned and results were visualized using Excel.
There has been a good performance with sales over the past month but based on the budget for ads for the next 3 month, it is needed to niche down to the percentage of our high performing audience. For this reason, the raw sales dataset has to be analyzed before appropriate decision can be made.
